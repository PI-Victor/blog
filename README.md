# My blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5ad271e0-3836-4a9c-b34b-f46d232fcad6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/friendly-engelbart-71e0ea/deploys)

This is my personal page, written from scratch with Vue.
The "backend" is really github and this blog is deployed from here directly
through netlify.
It uses vue and is stiched up together in a hot mess.
